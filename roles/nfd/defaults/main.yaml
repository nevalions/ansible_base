# nfd-worker CPU limit. The upstream default (200m) is too low for nodes with
# many hardware features — the worker bursts past it during discovery scans and
# gets throttled, which fires CPUThrottlingHigh (info) → InfoInhibitor noise.
# 500m is sufficient headroom without over-provisioning on small nodes.
