    Manage the CoreDNS ConfigMap in a kubeadm cluster.
    Applies a Corefile that sets explicit upstream resolvers, a tuned cache TTL,
    the health and ready plugins, and per-domain forward rules.
    Designed to eliminate intermittent SERVFAIL caused by relying on a node's
    /etc/resolv.conf chain (forward . /etc/resolv.conf) when nodes sit on
    different WireGuard segments (e.g. nodes on isolated VPN subnets).
